# Flight Price Predictor Model

This is my first model created using flask.
I have created this with the help of online tutorials available.
The model in python file and jupyter notebook, both are same, both are made by using Random Forest Algorithm. Only purpose of adding jupyter notebook was to see the output of each code block while creating model.
